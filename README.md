# AdvancedToDoListApp
An Advance To-Do List (AdvanceTODOList) is an enhanced version of a basic to-do list. It's designed not just to list tasks, but to manage and prioritize, categorize, schedule, and track progress on tasks using more advanced features.

Why We Use To-Do Lists:-
1)Stay Organized:
Helps you keep track of tasks so you don’t forget what needs to be done.
2)Boost Productivity:
Breaking down big projects into smaller tasks makes them easier to manage and finish.
3)Reduce Stress:
Writing tasks down clears your mind, so you don’t worry about forgetting something important.
4)Prioritize Tasks:
You can decide what’s most important or urgent and focus on those first
5)Track Progress:
Seeing completed tasks checked off gives you a sense of accomplishment and motivation.
6)Improve Time Management:
Helps you allocate your time wisely, avoid procrastination, and meet deadlines.

Real-Life Uses of To-Do Lists:-

School: Manage homework, assignments, exam prep, and group projects.
Home: Grocery shopping, cleaning, bill payments, appointments.
Personal Goals: Exercise plans, hobbies, reading lists, travel plans.
